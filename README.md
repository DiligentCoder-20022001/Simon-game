# Simon-game
A small memory game made with javascript

Simon game is a memory game where the user will be presented with a set of four buttons with different colours and on clicking each button a different type of sound will be given out. The game randomly generates a pattern which will be flashed acrossed the screen and the user has to follow that pattern .i.e. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. Download the zip folder and play the game to understand more.

HAPPY GAMING!
